Source reconstruction of the original Japanese TH20 v1.00a **Steamless**
executable. Function-level exactness requires reproducible comparison against
one hash-attested target. The workflow follows [TH095](https://github.com/N0zoM1z0/th095),
with Ghidra and a separate modern MSVC environment for TH20.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Reconstruction is in progress. Verified source components and exact function
> comparisons are available; the repository does not yet build a playable game.
> Origin review, source presence, exactness, linkage and runtime behavior are
> separate statuses.

## Exact target

Supply your own executable as `resources/th20.exe`:

| Property | Required value |
| --- | --- |
| Version | Japanese 1.00a, user-selected Steamless variant |
| Embedded title/replay label | 1.00c; recorded separately from registry/package identification |
| Size | `1,858,560` bytes |
| SHA-256 | `a274b45fe6ec53511718bb328c2ff169a74e67f95d1b0c74d97d348b955a0897` |
| MD5 | `e7ccdbd2f319ba868ce386e484fff1d3` |
| Image base | `0x00400000` |
| Entry point | `0x005435E0` |

```bash
scripts/import-target.sh /path/to/th20.exe
scripts/repo-python scripts/verify-target.py
```

The Steam-original backup is retained locally as provenance evidence. Its
code differs from the comparison target. See [target provenance](docs/TARGET_PROVENANCE.md)
for official Japanese release and independent executable identification.
Game executables, assets, private databases, toolchains and reference checkouts
are excluded from Git.

## Repository status

The maintained graph has **842 source-present mappings**, **827 physical strict
units** and **160 comparison objects** covering 160,921 disjoint comparison bytes.
Fifteen mapped whole functions remain nonexact. Confirmed authored exactness is
separately 94 functions / 30,383 bytes; it is not whole-game completion.

| Area | Current position |
| --- | --- |
| Target and analysis | Locked Japanese Steamless target and attested Ghidra 12.1.3 |
| Reference review | All 6,945 indexed implementations and 113 parser-gap files reviewed |
| ECL Runtime | Whole tick, call/frame/argument and lifetime protocols; [evidence](docs/EXACT_ECL_TICK_RECONSTRUCTION.md) |
| Animation | Lifetime, children, templates, frame/geometry/operand updates and real callbacks; whole VM remains open; [source map](docs/SOURCE_MAP.md) |
| Enemy | Actual owners and movement/script dependencies; whole opcode dispatcher remains open; [layout](docs/CORE_ENEMY_DISPATCH_LAYOUT.md) |
| Gameplay cores | Scheduler, hit ownership, Player/SHT, Bomb and Item protocols; [evidence index](docs/EVIDENCE_INDEX.md) |
| Archive and Progress | Actual codec/resource/file pipelines and serialization; remaining whole nonexact functions recorded in ledgers |
| Graphics and sound | Maintained mesh/lifecycle and sound loading; Renderer and full runtime ownership remain open |
| Whole-program build and runtime | Not yet available |

[Generated progress](docs/PROGRESS.md) and the status reporter provide live
authored totals. [The current handoff](docs/RE_HANDOFF.md) records remaining work
and local verification; [the evidence index](docs/EVIDENCE_INDEX.md) routes dated
investigations without mixing historical counts into current status.

The pinned toolchain candidate is MSVC 19.44.35211 x86, Windows SDK 10.0.26100.0
and D3DX 9.29.952.8. Accepted units use explicit per-source profiles. These results
do not establish executable-wide compiler flags, SDK or CRT identity.

## Build and verify

Public checks need Python 3.11+ and a C++20 compiler, with no original game or
proprietary toolchain:

```bash
scripts/repo-python scripts/ci.py
```

Private reconstruction checks:

```bash
scripts/bootstrap-tools.sh
scripts/repo-python scripts/verify-target.py
scripts/repo-python scripts/report-reconstruction-status.py --summary
scripts/repo-python scripts/validate-tracking.py --require-target
scripts/repo-python scripts/ghidra.py check
scripts/repo-python scripts/replay-exact-units.py
```

On a fresh private workspace, provision tools as described in
[Tools](docs/TOOLS.md), then run `scripts/repo-python scripts/ghidra.py import` once.
Every query re-attests the executable and complete mapped code section;
inventory refreshes never overwrite reviewed ledgers.

## Reference review

[Oracatt/Touhou20](https://github.com/Oracatt/Touhou20) is pinned locally under
ignored `_reference/Touhou20`. Its target hash matches ours. Its v1.00c label
comes from embedded strings; our v1.00a identification follows the independent
hash registry and supplied package. Both observations are preserved in provenance.

The [review](docs/REFERENCE_REVIEW.md) records the repository-wide evidence audit,
module dispositions, stale reports and independently verified absorption.
Validated source diagnostics route further analysis; reference source, build
layout and completion claims are not imported wholesale.

The [function-by-function review](docs/REFERENCE_FUNCTION_REVIEW.md) is complete
for all 6,945 indexed implementations, including one parser omission recovered
during manual review. All 113 parser-gap files are manually reconciled. The
[final audit](docs/REFERENCE_SUPPORT_REVIEW.md) records coverage and evidence
limits; nonexact implementations remain documented for further reconstruction.
